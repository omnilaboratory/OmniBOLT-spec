# Omni-BOLT-spec In-Progress Specifications

Based on the fundamental theory of Lightning network, Omni-BOLT specification describes how to enable OmniLayer assets to be transferred via ligtning channels, according to the [BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) ](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/00-introduction.md) specification, which is a layer-2 protocol for off-chain bitcoin transfer by mutual cooperation.

We name this new specification Omni-BOLT, in order to avoid possible conflicts with BOLT. We break down our task into two major steps: 

>the first step, we run nodes that are omni assets aware: for example, users can creat channels for USDT, which is issued on Omnilayer and BTC netowrk, then they will be able to transfer USDT more quick and more cheaper. 

>the second step, we will try to be compatible with existing Lightning Nodes around the world, if experts working on BOLT can work together with us.
